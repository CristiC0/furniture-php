            <p>
                Over the course of the middle of last century, Australian
                architecture changed forever with the influence of
                mid-century modernist design. Works by the likes of
                architects Robyn Boyd, Harry Siedler, Roy Grounds, McGlashan
                Everist, and Walter Burley Griffin took influence from the
                simple, functional design of modernist homes in Europe and
                The United States, and shaped Australian living and culture
                for generations, with comfortable, simple, modest homes in
                the suburbs.
            </p>

            <p>
                In no small part, Jardan has taken influence from the
                modernist furniture designers of the time – Grant
                Featherstone, Fred Lowen, Douglas Snelling, to name a few –
                people who’d recently immigrated to Australia from Europe,
                bringing with them an unprecedented wave of new skills and
                ideas, which are still reverberating through Australian
                suburban life today.

            Alongside our design influences, we’ve taken much inspiration
            from John and Sunday Reed, whose home (now the Heide Museum of
            Modern Art, in Melbourne) established a style of living for
            creative families. At their home, they shared residence with
            some of Australia’s most influential painters and artists
            including Sydney Nolan and Joy Hester, who would live on the
            farm for months on end while painting their most famous work.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so, because we create furniture for the Australian way of
            life, our Richmond showroom is inspired by the homes made by the
            country’s renowned architects and designers. “Upstairs was
            inspired by the work of Harry Siedler, a Sydney architect who
            designed, amongst other things, a home for his mother,” says Iva
            Forschia, the owner and principal of Melbourne architecture
            practice, IF Architecture, from her Melbourne office. “It was so
            different at the time. The spaces were defined by free standing
            walls. It was a simple, honest, modernist style home.”

            Upstairs in the Jardan Richmond Store, there’s this sense that
            you’re walking into a living room, with seperate bedrooms, a
            fire place, and a kitchen. “To the left upstairs, we’ve created
            bedrooms and used colour to make you imagine that it’s a real
            home. You get a sense that this could be your living room, and
            we’ve tried to set it out so that it inspires people to apply
            things to their own interiors,” says Iva. “To the right side
            when you get upstairs, we’ve referenced John and Sunday Reed,
            who created the Heidi Gallery and Museum in Melbourne. John and
            Sunday Reed nurtured artists who were staying at their home.
            They were known for having long lunches, for entertaining by the
            fire and reading books from the bookshelves, huddling together
            in the colder months. There’s these incredible stories of Sunday
            Reed cooking while some of Australia’s most famous artists
            painted on the kitchen table.”

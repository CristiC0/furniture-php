            <h2>Sydney — 42 Oxford Street Paddington, NSW 2021</h2>
            <p>
                Every year as the seasons change in Sydney, the city is
                dominated by a shifting landscape of colour. The deep blues
                of the Sydney harbour, the green canopy that covers the
                hilly streets in Rose Bay, Surry Hills, and Paddington, the
                reds and yellows that stream through the trees in the
                afternoon sun. In winter when the sunlight is scarce, Sydney
                Harbour turns a deep blue, the colours defining a mood that
                filters through everyone who lives in the city.
            </p>

                At our Sydney store, Architect Iva Foschia – founder,
                principal, and lead architect of IF Architecture – wanted to
                express the way that colour has influenced the culture of
                the city, and in the process, pay homage to the Australian
                families who have helped us to better understand them
                through art and design.

            And so the design of our new showroom started with the work of
            some of Australia’s most influential families in art and design:
            Brett Whiteley, who famously painted Sydney Harbour in deep
            ultramarine blue from his balcony, inspired by his muses, wife
            Wendy and daughter Arkie. John Olsen, who used a vibrant palate
            of blues and greens in A Salute to Sydney, and in the process
            inspired the colourful work of his daughter Louise Olsen and
            Stephen Ormandy – partners and designers of Dinosaur Designs.
            The work of Dinosaur Designs is incredibly colourful, too, with
            vivid oranges, blues, and greens that have helped to shape the
            way Australian’s view Sydney. Marion Hall Best, too, whose
            interior design work through the middle of last century had a
            great influence on the city’s interior architecture.

            Speaking from her office in Melbourne, Iva Foschia says that in
            making a space that reflects the Jardan values of family she
            wanted to express the work of our country’s most influential
            creative families. “Colour and family are big parts of the
            Jardan story,” says Iva, “so looking at Sydney families, I was
            immediately inspired by the work of Brett Whiteley and his muse,
            daughter Arkie. Brett was completely inspired by Arkie and said
            that he couldn’t work without her, so there was a lovely
            connection with Jardan, being a family business. Marion Hall
            Best ran a beautiful store too, she was a wonderful woman and
            her and her daughter had a little interiors shop not too far
            from the Jardan showroom in Sydney, and similarly they worked
            together for years and had a real community minded approach.”

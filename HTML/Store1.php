            <h2>Perth — 488 Stirling Highway Peppermint Grove, WA 6011</h2>
            <p>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

            <p>
                Maybe it’s the fact the sun sets over the ocean, throwing a
                whole new light over things. Or maybe it’s the distinct and
                rapid transformation from urban to country. Whatever it is,
                Western Australia is an immense state of unique beauty and
                unmatched vastness; arid and abundant at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                “There’s a ‘mind-picture’ we have of the West Coast” says
                Iva Foschia, founder and principal of IF Architecture,
                alluding to the open roads and landscapes, flora and
                wildlife. “When we were researching and exploring, the
                Western Australian wildflowers caught our attention,” says
                Foschia, “a natural phenomenon that only exists there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It was in these moments that Foschia and her team found what
                they were looking for.

            “The wildflowers became the path,” Foschia adds, literally. The
            new space still adheres to the language she created for the
            Melbourne store; a space that feels like home with rooms
            designed to welcome, encourage and embrace and not simply a
            warehouse of goods. This time, instead of the established
            rectilinear path, Perth is looser, like a walk through the
            wildflowers, joining each space or room in a less formal manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perth is Jardan’s fourth store and the first on the west coast
            and while individual city context plays a large part in all the
            flagship spaces, it is with Perth that more abstract concepts
            and freer ideas have been added and introduced to the Jardan
            vernacular.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The other stores are more intuitive, (in Perth) the landscape
            is a lot more prominent.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “(We are looking) to capture the depth of this visual treat as
            you approach the store and venture inside.” This is still a
            response to the state, and about bringing part of the Jardan
            Melbourne experience, but Perth has been given the ability to
            build upon these now recognisable ‘rules’ and create a feeling
            of its own.

            Speaking over the phone, a direct response to Covid19 and the
            effect it has taken on all of us, Foschia talks of the work
            she’s done in hospitality and design’s close connection to the
            most successful projects. “It’s in the relationships and how
            they’re aligned with taking care of people, how the experiential
            is key”
        </p>
        <p>
            As designers and makers, it’s no good just throwing furniture in
            a room and hoping for the best. These spaces are how we love to
            see our furniture; in situ, in action and in use, take away the
            meaning and what are you left with?
        </p>
        <p>
            Jardan will always draw on the environment and Australia’s
            unwavering connection to the landscape, just as Jardan spaces
            will build on colour and a multitude of art, design and
            architectural influences. It’s how we build and add that is
            important. With a language now established, Perth is a chance to
            play with these motifs, an extension of the connections we have
            as Australians to the coastlines and country. It’s just now that
            it features a new sunset and a new way to look at the work we
            do. Call it a meander, this is an interior walk designed to
            evoke the country and environment it sits in.
